# Micro SD Card Instructions

To copy the sound effects files from the CW3D GitHub site, try the following detailed steps:

**Step 1: Downloading the GitHub Repository as a Zip File**

- Open your web browser and go to the GitHub repository https://github.com/crashworks3d/Iron_Man_Servo/tree/v3.0.1.2.
- Click on the "Code" button, which is usually located near the top-right corner of the repository page.
- Select "Download ZIP" from the dropdown menu. This will initiate the download of a zip file containing the entire repository.
- Choose a location on your computer where you want to save the downloaded zip file. _Make sure to remember this location as you'll need it for the next steps._

**Step 2: Extracting the Zip File**

- Navigate to the location where you saved the downloaded zip file.
- Right-click on the zip file and select "Extract All..." from the context menu. This will open the "Extract Compressed (Zipped) Folders" wizard.
- In the wizard, choose a destination folder where you want to extract the contents of the zip file. You can click the "Browse" button to select a specific folder.
- Click the "Extract" button. Windows will now extract all the files from the zip archive into the selected folder.

**Step 3: Copying MP3 Files to the Micro SD Card One at a Time**

- Insert the pre-formatted micro SD card into your computer's card reader slot or a compatible USB card reader.
- Open File Explorer (Windows Explorer).
- Locate the folder where you extracted the GitHub repository in the left sidebar of File Explorer. Click on it to open it.
- Inside the repository folder, navigate to the "mp3" directory where your MP3 files are stored.
- In the "mp3" folder, locate the MP3 file named "0001.mp3."
- Right-click on "0001.mp3," select "Copy" from the context menu.
- In File Explorer, locate the micro SD card drive. It will usually appear as a removable disk under "This PC" or "My Computer." Double-click to open it.

- Right-click within the micro SD card folder (root directory), and select "Paste" from the context menu. This will copy "0001.mp3" to the micro SD card.
- Wait for the copying process to complete.
- Repeat the same process for "0002.mp3" and "0003.mp3" one at a time, copying them to the micro SD card individually.
