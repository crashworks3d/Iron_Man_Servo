# Iron Man Helmet Servo and Audio Controller for Arduino

![Iron Man Mark 85 Avengers End Game - Marvel](images/DSC01481.png)

The purpose of this project is to automate features of the various models of the Iron Man 3D printed helmet.  This project was created with the purpose of enabling fans like you to be able to more easily make your own automated helmet. We encourage you to learn from this as well as provide feedback for us to improve upon it.

## Getting Started

It will be helpful but not necessary if you have a basic level of programming experience as well as a little experience programming Arduino micro controllers.  This project was created using the [Aurduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/).  Clone or download this repository at your own risk.

You can download the 3D printable servo kit from Thingiverse:

[Thingiverse MK85 Iron Man Servo Kit](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4607836)

[Thingiverse MK46 Iron Man Servo Kit](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4640029)

[Thingiverse MK7 Iron Man Servo Kit](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4630066)

[Thingiverse Marvel Legends Iron Man Servo Kit](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5175364)

**You can purchase an easy to install and use Arduino shield (Nano included) designed specifically for this project. This Board comes pre-flashed with the Crashworks code installed.**

### Prerequisites

* Some experience with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)

* Be sure to have the Arduino Nano board installed in your environment.
* Install the [VarSpeedServo](https://github.com/netlabtoolkit/VarSpeedServo) library.
* Install the [Bounce2](https://github.com/thomasfredericks/Bounce2) library.
* Install the [ButtonEvents](https://github.com/fasteddy516/ButtonEvents) library.
* Install the [DFRobotDFPlayerMini](https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobotDFPlayerMini) library. 
* An Arduino Nano board
* Servos
* LEDs
* Resistors

(See BOM below for details.)

### Installing

1.  In the Arduino IDE be sure to set the appropriate board (Arduino Nano) and ports to match your environment.
2. Complile and load onto your Arduino Nano following the [Arduino IDE instructions](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide).

Successful installation will result in the servos moving the faceplate into the "closed" or "down" position and the activation of the LED (eyes).  When the button is pushed, the servos will move to the "open" or "up" position and the LED (eyes) will turn off.
